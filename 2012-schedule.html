				<h1 class="banner banner-green">Keynotes &amp; Talks</h1>
			
				<p>The keynotes and lightning talks aim to inspire by providing ideas and concepts to consider as well as detailed and specific information on projects. Lightning talks are provided by some of the Lab Facilitators from each lab.</p>

				<h2>Day 1</h2>
				<h3 id="miebach">Nathalie Miebach</h3>
				<p><strong>Bio:</strong> A sculptor based in the Boston, MA whose work focuses on the intersection of art and science and the visual articulation of scientific observations. Nathalie has recently presented her work at world-renown forums such as Eyeo Festival and TED. Her work translates scientific data related to astronomy, ecology and meteorology into physical woven sculptures. Weaving provides a grid through which to interpret data in three-dimensional space. Her sculptures tread an uneasy divide between functioning both as sculptures in space as well as instruments that could be used in the actual environment from which the data originates.</p>

				<h3 id="lipson">Hod Lipson</h3>
				<p><strong>Keynote Summary:</strong> Programmable matter: The present and future of 3D printing.</p>
				<p><strong>Bio:</strong> An American robotics engineer. He is the director of Cornell University's Creative Machines Lab, at the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, where he is also an Associate Professor of Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering. Lipson is the creator of Fab@Home, the open source personal fabricator project, which was awarded a MacArthur grant. Lipson is well published and recent publications include, Factory@Home, The Emerging Economy of Personal Fabrication, a report commissioned by the Whitehouse Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>

				<h2>Day 2</h2>
				<h3 id="perry">Marco Perry</h3>
				<p><strong>Keynote Summary:</strong> 3D Printing works very well to print volumes, but not forms made of lines in space. To address this need, Pensa created the DIWire - an open source CNC wire bender that is as easy to use as a 3D printer, and is small and affordable for the enthusiast. Marco will show what the DIWire can do today, a future vision for its capabilities, and a peak at the potential for mass adoption of rapid prototyping.</p>
				<p><strong>Bio:</strong> An industrial designer and co-founder of Pensa NYC, a strategic design consultancy composed of multidisciplinary team, and the creator of DIWire Bender, a rapid prototype machine that bends metal wire to produce 2d or 3D shapes. DIWire bender is essentially a 3D printer that describes lines instead of volumes in space, and it could be used for anything from prototypes to customized products. </p>

				<p>DIWire Bender is attracting interest from many varied disciplines from dentistry and medical fields to artists and product designers.</p>

				<h3 id="nervous">Nervous System</h3>
				<p><strong>Bio:</strong> A design studio at the intersection of science, art and technology. Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg focus on generative design writing algorithms based on processes and patterns found in nature. Unique patterns and forms generated and applied to an array of products, which are created utilizing digital fabrication technologies. Engaging the Creative Commons movement, applets are available online for anyone to experiment and learn with. </p>

				<p>Digital fabrication is a process that includes the digital creation of 2D and 3D content whose manufacture is, in part or in whole, realized through the use of computer controlled machines. The process begins with computer modeling. This can be something as simple as a planar (2D) line drawing or as complicated as spatial models (3D). There are various techniques and methods of creating these digital models.</p>

				<p>The next part of the digital fabrication process is to generate physical translations of the digital models. When the physical object is created (output) the digital models are sent to a computer-controlled machine as a set of instructions so that the duplication process may begin and be repeated. There are many different types of technologies and methods for creating the physical objects. This lab will present an advanced and intro overview of the leading computer modeling and 3D printing technologies.

				<p>This lab will focus on building interactive physical systems. Attendees will explore how humans and environments engage with computers via sound, heat, motion, light, and other inputs using sensors. This lab will push participants beyond standard human-computer interaction devices such as the keyboard, video and mouse.</p>

				<p>Taking a hands-on approach, participants will have a collaborative space to build circuits, solder, code programs and build structures to hold sensors and controls that interact with people and space. A variety of workshops will be offered throughout the weekend including 'Introduction to Arduino', 'Overview of Arduino Shields' and 'Hacking your Toaster to the Internet'.</p>
